# Data 
The data folder contains Dataset Class, Dataloader and necessary data vectorization functions 

The base.py file contains the root dataset class (DELFTDataset).

For our experimented tasks (Qblink, QANTA and TriviaQA), each file contains the task specific class inherited from the root class.
