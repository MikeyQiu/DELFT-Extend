# Experiment

For training Qblink with default parameters, run python main_qblink.py (--test for Evaluation)
For training QANTA with default parameters, run python main_qanta.py (--test for Evaluation)
For training TriviaQA with default parameters, run python main_triviaqa.py (--test for Evaluation)

# Note

The Bert model training and evaluation takes much longer training than Glove embeddings (it takes multiple days on single standard GPU)
